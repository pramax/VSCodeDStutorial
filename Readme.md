A Python 3.10 version environment was created using the Anaconda command line prompt:
> conda create -n myenv python=3.10 pandas jupyter seaborn scikit-learn keras tensorflow

This environ was used as a Kernel for this project.

Public data set about survivability on the Titanic was used. Seaborn is used visualise data.
Then a classification model is used to predict survivability based on age, gender, relatives etc. It shows an accuracy of 75%.
